# Experience
## Eleme (10/2018 ~ present)
### Crocodile Delivery Platform
Project Description:
The project is a selection and delivery platform for Eleme's C-end users. It is used to select a group of merchants/products based on specified rules. After building the platform and setting up the pages, the designated pages are displayed in a specific resource location within the Eleme app based on specific rules such as time, region, and target audience.

My Contributions and Responsibilities:
I was responsible for the development and construction of the end-to-end application, utilizing React and Ant Design to build the frontend interface, ensuring a user-friendly interface with a great user experience.
I designed and implemented a form rendering solution based on JSONSchema and react-jsonschema-form, simplifying the integration process for new delivery scenarios. This reduced the integration time to just 10-30 minutes with approximately 200 lines of configuration code, greatly improving the team's efficiency.
I used Midway to build the interface service and collaborated with the backend team to ensure seamless integration and correct data transmission between the frontend and backend.

Project Achievements and Highlights:
Successfully built and maintained the powerful delivery platform, user operation platform, and task platform, providing the company with robust operation and management tools.
The designed form rendering solution significantly simplified the integration process for new delivery scenarios, saving the team time and effort. Within a year, the number of delivery scenarios expanded from 25 to 200+, generating over 90,000 instances of operational configuration data.
Designed self-service integration processes and issue troubleshooting tools, further optimizing the efficiency of integration and operational issue resolution.
### B-end Order System
Project Description:
The project is the B-end order page for Eleme, used by merchants to accept orders, print receipts, prepare meals, and track order status. It is a page that merchants use on a daily basis when they open their computers, with a daily UV of around 200,000.

My Contributions and Responsibilities:
I was responsible for the daily development and maintenance of the B-end order page for merchants.
At the beginning of the project, I conducted a detailed analysis of the order business and formulated a refactoring plan based on micro frontend technology to refactor the order page.
I conducted research on the printing module and formulated an upgrade plan to migrate the receipt printing from local printing to cloud printing mode.

Project Achievements and Highlights:
During the refactoring and release of the order page, stability was maintained without any issues.
Through the refactoring, the page loading time was reduced from 7.1 seconds to 3.1 seconds, significantly improving the page loading speed and user experience.
Successfully adapted the receipt module to XP system computers, ensuring that merchants can print receipts properly on different operating systems.
### Unified Merchant Operation Platform
Project Description:
The project is the B-end merchant operation platform for Eleme, used for monitoring and managing exceptional issues throughout the entire process of merchant operations. For example, regarding the issue of low product quality on the platform, it can identify problematic merchants and initiate corresponding corrective actions. The core features include a flowchart editor and form settings for rule nodes.

My Contributions and Responsibilities:
I was responsible for requirement review, solution development, coordinating tasks among team members, and tracking the progress of requirements.
Using AntV6, I completed the development of the flowchart editor and the conversion of data format from AntV6 to BPMN.

Project Achievements and Highlights:
I successfully completed the development of requirements with high quality and smoothly conducted testing and deployment of the functionalities.
I documented standardized development guidelines for B-end operation platform applications, reducing the development costs for future team members.
### Electron windows app
Project Description:
The project is the PC version of the Eleme merchant app. Merchants typically use this client to access the B-end pages. The core capability of this client is receipt printing, as there is currently no web API available to access the system-connected printers.

My Contributions and Responsibilities:
I participated in the transformation of the desktop version from nw.js to Electron. I was responsible for writing installation and uninstallation scripts, designing and developing the automatic upgrade feature, as well as migrating the printing module.
I am responsible for the ongoing maintenance of the new client, including feature optimization, troubleshooting and fixing issues reported by merchants.

Project Achievements and Highlights:
Through the client upgrade, we upgraded the Chrome kernel from v50 to v96, resulting in approximately a 20% performance improvement and enhancing the user experience for those using the new client.
With the help of the company's gateway platform-designed automatic upgrade feature, client updates can be easily conducted in a controlled manner.
The new client established a comprehensive error and crash log reporting mechanism, addressing printing issues that were difficult to handle in the old client.
