# Experience
## Eleme (10/2018 ~ present)
### crocodile delivery platform
Project Description:
The project is a selection and delivery platform for Ele.me's C-end users. It is used to select a group of merchants/products based on specified rules. After building the platform and setting up the pages, the designated pages are displayed in a specific resource location within the Ele.me app based on specific rules such as time, region, and target audience.

My Contributions and Responsibilities:
I was responsible for the development and construction of the end-to-end application, utilizing React and Ant Design to build the frontend interface, ensuring a user-friendly interface with a great user experience.
I designed and implemented a form rendering solution based on JSONSchema and react-jsonschema-form, simplifying the integration process for new delivery scenarios. This reduced the integration time to just 10-30 minutes with approximately 200 lines of configuration code, greatly improving the team's efficiency.
I used Midway to build the interface service and collaborated with the backend team to ensure seamless integration and correct data transmission between the frontend and backend.

Project Achievements and Highlights:
Successfully built and maintained the powerful delivery platform, user operation platform, and task platform, providing the company with robust operation and management tools.
The designed form rendering solution significantly simplified the integration process for new delivery scenarios, saving the team time and effort. Within a year, the number of delivery scenarios expanded from 25 to 200+, generating over 90,000 instances of operational configuration data.
Designed self-service integration processes and issue troubleshooting tools, further optimizing the efficiency of integration and operational issue resolution.
